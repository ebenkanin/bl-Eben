Git is a version control system that helps us to track changes we make to our work or a project we might be working on.
Git is important because of the following reasons.
It allows us to track and keep all the changes we make to our work. If for one reason or the other, we want to scrap the current version of a project we are working on and roll back to a previous version, git helps us to do that.

It also allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time. 
Log in to your account on GitHub. You should be able to see a plus sign with a drop down carrot beside it on the top right hand side of the page. Click it to create a new repository. 

After clicking, you'll be asked to enter the name you wish to give your repository. I recommend you add a Readme file since this will tell anyone accessing your repo about what the repo is about.

next, open git bash and clone the repo by running git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame.git

next cd into your repo and create the files you wish to work on. 
add the file to the staging area using git addfile name
commit the changes using git commit -myour commit message
finally push it to your repo using git push
